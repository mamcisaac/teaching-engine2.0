# AI Prompting Best Practices

Getting the most from Teaching Engine 2.0's AI features depends on how you communicate with the system. Effective prompting is a skill that improves with practice and makes AI assistance far more valuable.

## The Art of Effective Prompting

### What Makes a Good Prompt?

**Specific and Detailed**
- Include grade level, subject, and specific learning goals
- Mention available time, resources, and constraints
- Specify student needs and classroom context
- Define the type of output you want

**Clear and Well-Structured**
- Use clear, simple language
- Organize information logically
- Break complex requests into smaller parts
- Include all necessary context upfront

**Action-Oriented**
- Start with action words: "Create," "Design," "Suggest," "Generate"
- Specify the format you want (list, lesson plan, rubric, etc.)
- Include any requirements or constraints
- Mention the intended audience (students, parents, colleagues)

## Prompting Formula for Success

### The CLEAR Framework

**C - Context**: What's the situation?
**L - Learning Goals**: What should students achieve?
**E - Environment**: What are the constraints and resources?
**A - Action**: What specific output do you need?
**R - Requirements**: What special considerations apply?

### Example Using CLEAR

**Poor Prompt**: "Create a math lesson"

**CLEAR Prompt**: 
- **Context**: Grade 4 class of 28 students, some struggling with basic multiplication
- **Learning Goals**: Students will understand area concepts through hands-on measurement
- **Environment**: 60-minute period, limited manipulatives, access to tablets
- **Action**: Create a three-part lesson plan with differentiated activities
- **Requirements**: Include formative assessment and accommodate two students with processing delays

## Subject-Specific Prompting Strategies

### Mathematics Prompting

**Effective Math Prompts Include**:
- Specific mathematical concept or skill
- Grade-appropriate vocabulary and difficulty
- Real-world contexts students relate to
- Multiple solution strategies or approaches
- Assessment criteria for mathematical thinking

**Example Math Prompts**:
```
"Create 5 word problems for Grade 3 students practicing two-digit addition with regrouping. Include problems about school events they would recognize, show different problem structures (join, compare, part-whole), and provide a simple rubric for assessing problem-solving strategies."

"Design a hands-on activity for Grade 6 students to explore equivalent fractions using visual models. The activity should take 30 minutes, work for groups of 4, and include extension questions for students who finish early."
```

### Language Arts Prompting

**Effective Language Prompts Include**:
- Specific text type or writing purpose
- Audience and writing context
- Reading level considerations
- Process skills (planning, drafting, revising)
- Assessment focus areas

**Example Language Prompts**:
```
"Generate a scaffolded writing activity for Grade 2 students to write thank-you letters to community helpers. Include a planning template, sentence starters for reluctant writers, and criteria for assessing letter-writing conventions."

"Create a literature circle discussion guide for Grade 5 students reading realistic fiction. Include role cards that promote deep thinking, discussion prompts about character development, and a reflection activity connecting to students' own experiences."
```

### Science Prompting

**Effective Science Prompts Include**:
- Specific science concept or inquiry skill
- Hands-on investigation or exploration opportunities
- Connection to real-world phenomena
- Safety considerations and materials list
- Scientific thinking and communication skills

**Example Science Prompts**:
```
"Design a Grade 4 investigation about plant adaptations that students can conduct in the classroom. Include observation tools, prediction sheets, and questions that help students connect structure to function. Accommodate students who may have plant allergies."

"Create a Grade 6 lesson introducing simple machines through everyday objects. Include a discovery activity where students identify machines in common tools, followed by a design challenge using available classroom materials."
```

### Social Studies Prompting

**Effective Social Studies Prompts Include**:
- Specific historical period or geographic concept
- Multiple perspectives and diverse voices
- Inquiry questions and critical thinking
- Primary source connections when appropriate
- Local or relevant connections for students

**Example Social Studies Prompts**:
```
"Develop a Grade 3 activity exploring community traditions that celebrates the diversity in our classroom. Include interview questions students can ask family members, a sharing format that honors different cultures, and reflection questions about community belonging."

"Create a Grade 5 inquiry activity about early Canadian settlements. Include primary source images, perspective-taking questions about different groups (Indigenous peoples, settlers, fur traders), and a culminating activity that demonstrates understanding of multiple viewpoints."
```

## Differentiation and Inclusion Prompting

### Prompting for Diverse Learners

**Include Specific Needs**:
- Learning differences and accommodations required
- English language learning considerations
- Physical accessibility requirements
- Social-emotional support needs
- Cultural and family contexts

**Example Differentiation Prompts**:
```
"Adapt this Grade 4 measurement activity for three different learning needs: a student who struggles with fine motor skills, a student learning English who excels in math concepts, and a student who finishes quickly and needs extension challenges."

"Create choice board activities for a Grade 6 science unit on biodiversity. Include options for different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), varying complexity levels, and ways students can show learning beyond traditional writing."
```

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Prompts

**Multiple Means of Representation**:
```
"Design three different ways to introduce the concept of equivalent fractions to Grade 5 students: one using visual models, one using real-world examples, and one using hands-on manipulatives."
```

**Multiple Means of Engagement**:
```
"Create four different entry points for a Grade 3 writing unit about personal narratives: one connecting to family traditions, one using favorite books as models, one starting with photographs, and one beginning with partner storytelling."
```

**Multiple Means of Expression**:
```
"Generate five different ways Grade 4 students can demonstrate their understanding of provincial government: written report, visual infographic, oral presentation, dramatic performance, and interactive poster."
```

## Assessment and Evaluation Prompting

### Creating Assessment Tools

**Formative Assessment Prompts**:
```
"Design quick check-in tools for monitoring Grade 2 student understanding during a subtraction lesson. Include options for verbal, written, and gesture-based responses that take less than 5 minutes to implement."

"Create exit ticket questions for a Grade 6 unit on ecosystems that help identify misconceptions about food chains and energy flow."
```

**Summative Assessment Prompts**:
```
"Develop a performance task for Grade 5 students to demonstrate understanding of different text forms. Include choice in topics, clear success criteria, and accommodation options for students with learning differences."

"Generate a rubric for assessing Grade 3 oral presentations about animals, including criteria for content accuracy, presentation skills, and visual aids, with language accessible to students and parents."
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Iterative Prompting

**Start Broad, Then Narrow**:
1. "Suggest activities for teaching Grade 4 fractions"
2. "From those suggestions, expand on the visual model activities"
3. "Create detailed instructions for the pizza fraction activity"
4. "Add differentiation options for struggling learners"

### Combination Prompting

**Connect Multiple Elements**:
```
"Create a cross-curricular lesson connecting Grade 5 social studies (early settlements) with language arts (descriptive writing) and art (historical illustrations). Include research skills, creative expression, and historical thinking."
```

### Perspective Prompting

**Multiple Viewpoints**:
```
"Design activities for Grade 6 students to explore the Canadian Confederation from three perspectives: Indigenous peoples, French Canadians, and British settlers. Include primary sources and discussion formats that promote respectful dialogue."
```

## Common Prompting Mistakes to Avoid

### Too Vague or General
**Avoid**: "Make a lesson about animals"
**Try**: "Create a Grade 2 lesson about animal habitats focusing on how animals meet their basic needs, using local wildlife examples and hands-on sorting activities"

### Missing Context
**Avoid**: "Create math problems for homework"
**Try**: "Generate 8 math problems for Grade 4 homework reviewing area and perimeter, using contexts students know (playground, classroom, home) with visual supports for English language learners"

### Unrealistic Expectations
**Avoid**: "Plan a complete unit with all materials and assessments"
**Try**: "Create the framework for a Grade 3 plant unit including main topics, key activities, and assessment ideas that I can develop further"

### Ignoring Student Diversity
**Avoid**: "Make activities for typical students"
**Try**: "Design activities for a diverse Grade 5 class including students with ADHD, English language learners, and gifted learners, ensuring everyone can participate meaningfully"
