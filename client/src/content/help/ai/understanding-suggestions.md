# Understanding AI Suggestions

Learning to effectively evaluate, adapt, and implement AI suggestions is crucial for getting the most value from Teaching Engine 2.0. This guide helps you develop the skills to work collaboratively with AI for optimal teaching outcomes.

## How AI Generates Suggestions

### Understanding the Process

**Training Foundation**
- AI learns from thousands of exemplary Ontario lesson plans
- Educational research and best practices inform all suggestions
- ETFO-aligned teaching strategies guide recommendation patterns
- Current curriculum documents shape content alignment

**Pattern Recognition**
- AI identifies successful combinations of learning goals and activities
- Teaching strategies that work well together are prioritized
- Student engagement patterns inform activity suggestions
- Assessment integration follows proven pedagogical sequences

**Contextual Adaptation**
- Your specific inputs (grade, subject, constraints) filter suggestions
- Previous successful adaptations in similar contexts influence recommendations
- Resource availability and timing considerations modify suggestions
- Local curriculum requirements shape content suggestions

### What This Means for You

**Suggestions Are Starting Points**
- AI provides professionally informed foundations to build upon
- Your expertise and knowledge of your students is essential
- Local context and school culture require your professional judgment
- Creative adaptation and personalization make suggestions truly effective

## Evaluating AI Suggestions

### Quality Assessment Framework

**1. Curriculum Alignment Check**
- Do suggested activities clearly address the stated learning goals?
- Are curriculum expectations explicitly connected to learning experiences?
- Is the developmental appropriateness accurate for your grade level?
- Are assessment opportunities aligned with curriculum requirements?

**2. Pedagogical Soundness Review**
- Do activities follow research-based best practices?
- Is the three-part lesson structure well-implemented?
- Are different learning modalities represented appropriately?
- Does the suggested sequence support effective learning progression?

**3. Student Suitability Analysis**
- Will these activities engage your specific students?
- Are differentiation suggestions adequate for your class needs?
- Do activities accommodate the learning differences in your classroom?
- Are suggested modifications realistic and helpful?

**4. Practical Feasibility Assessment**
- Can you implement suggestions with available resources?
- Is the timing realistic for your schedule and context?
- Are material requirements manageable and accessible?
- Do suggestions fit within your classroom space and setup?

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Content Concerns**
- Factual inaccuracies or outdated information
- Cultural insensitivity or limited perspectives
- Age-inappropriate complexity or simplicity
- Missing safety considerations for activities

**Pedagogical Issues**
- Activities that don't match stated learning goals
- Assessment strategies disconnected from learning objectives
- Unrealistic timing expectations
- Insufficient scaffolding for student success

**Practical Problems**
- Resource requirements beyond typical classroom availability
- Safety concerns not addressed
- Classroom management challenges not considered
- Technology requirements exceeding school capacity

## Adapting Suggestions for Your Context

### Personalization Strategies

**Student-Centered Modifications**
- Adjust language complexity for your students' reading levels
- Incorporate student interests and cultural backgrounds
- Modify activities for specific learning needs in your class
- Add supports for English language learners

**Example Adaptation**:
*AI Suggestion*: "Students research different biomes using online resources"
*Your Adaptation*: "Students research different biomes using a combination of online resources, library books, and interview with local naturalist, with graphic organizers provided for ELL students and extension research questions for advanced learners"

**Resource-Based Adjustments**
- Substitute suggested materials with available alternatives
- Adapt technology-based activities for limited tech access
- Modify group sizes based on classroom space
- Adjust activities for available time constraints

**Example Adaptation**:
*AI Suggestion*: "Use digital presentation software to create ecosystem posters"
*Your Adaptation*: "Create ecosystem posters using chart paper and art supplies, with option to photograph and share digitally for students with access to devices"

**Cultural and Community Integration**
- Connect activities to local community and environment
- Include diverse perspectives and examples
- Incorporate family and cultural knowledge
- Address current events and relevant issues

**Example Adaptation**:
*AI Suggestion*: "Explore different celebrations around the world"
*Your Adaptation*: "Explore different celebrations around the world, starting with celebrations represented in our classroom families, and invite family members to share their traditions"

### Building on AI Foundations

**Expansion Strategies**
- Extend single-lesson suggestions into multi-day experiences
