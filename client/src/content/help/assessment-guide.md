# Assessment Guide for Teachers

## Understanding Assessment Types

### Diagnostic Assessment (Assessment FOR Learning)
**When:** Before or at the beginning of instruction  
**Purpose:** To determine what students already know and identify learning needs  
**Focus:** Finding starting points and planning instruction

**Examples:**
- KWL charts (Know, Want to know, Learned)
- Pre-tests or pre-assessments
- Class discussions to gauge understanding
- Entrance tickets
- Thumbs up/down/sideways checks
- Student surveys about prior knowledge
- Concept maps or mind maps
- Quick polls or show of hands

### Formative Assessment (Assessment AS Learning)
**When:** During the learning process  
**Purpose:** To provide ongoing feedback and help students monitor their own learning  
**Focus:** Learning process and student self-reflection

**Examples:**
- Exit tickets with key questions
- Peer feedback sessions
- Self-reflection journals
- Mini-whiteboards for quick responses
- Think-pair-share activities
- Observation checklists
- One-minute papers
- Traffic light cards (green=understand, yellow=unsure, red=need help)
- Student conferences
- Draft work with feedback
- Practice problems with immediate feedback

### Summative Assessment (Assessment OF Learning)
**When:** At the end of a learning period  
**Purpose:** To evaluate student achievement and assign grades  
**Focus:** Final products and overall achievement

**Examples:**
- Unit tests or final exams
- Final projects with rubrics
- Presentations
- Portfolios
- Performance tasks
- Research papers
- Lab reports
- End-of-term assignments
- Culminating activities

## Writing Success Criteria

Success criteria are clear, specific statements that describe what success looks like. They should be:
- Written in student-friendly language
- Observable and measurable
- Focused on the learning goals
- Used by students for self-assessment

### Format: "I can..." statements

**Good Examples:**
- I can identify the main idea and supporting details in a text
- I can solve two-digit addition problems using regrouping
- I can create a hypothesis for a science experiment
- I can use transition words to connect my ideas in writing

**Avoid:**
- Vague language ("I can do math better")
- Teacher-focused language ("Students will understand...")
- Activities instead of learning ("I can complete the worksheet")

## Assessment Strategies by Subject

### Language Arts
- Reading response journals
- Writing portfolios
- Oral reading assessments
- Peer editing checklists
- Book talks
- Writing conferences

### Mathematics
- Problem-solving journals
- Math talks
- Error analysis activities
- Real-world application tasks
- Math manipulative demonstrations

### Science
- Lab reports
- Science notebooks
- Experimental design tasks
- Model creation and explanation
- Scientific drawings with labels

### Social Studies
- Research projects
- Historical thinking activities
- Map skills assessments
- Current events connections
- Role-play or simulations

## Tips for Effective Assessment

1. **Use a variety of assessment types** - Don't rely on just one form
2. **Make criteria clear** - Students should know what success looks like
3. **Provide timely feedback** - The sooner, the better for learning
4. **Involve students** - Self and peer assessment builds understanding
5. **Focus on growth** - Compare students to their own previous performance
6. **Document observations** - Keep anecdotal notes for evidence
7. **Differentiate assessments** - Provide multiple ways to show learning

## Creating a Balanced Assessment Plan

A well-rounded unit should include:
- **1-2 diagnostic assessments** at the beginning
- **Multiple formative assessments** throughout
- **1-2 summative assessments** at the end
- **Ongoing self-assessment** opportunities
- **Regular feedback** cycles

Remember: Assessment should inform your teaching and help students understand their own learning journey!
