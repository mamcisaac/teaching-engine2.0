2. **Review systematically**: Go through each subject and strand carefully
3. **Involve colleagues**: Get input on organization and terminology
4. **Test integration**: Try using imported content in planning tools

### Quality Assurance

1. **Cross-reference**: Compare imported content to original documents
2. **Check completeness**: Ensure all expectations are captured
3. **Verify relationships**: Confirm connections between expectations
4. **Update regularly**: Re-import when curriculum documents change

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Import Fails or Errors

**File Format Issues:**
- Convert to supported format (PDF, Word, Text)
- Check file size limits (usually under 50MB)
- Ensure file isn't password protected
- Try breaking large files into smaller sections

**Processing Errors:**
- Check document quality (not scanned images)
