# ETFO-Aligned Planning Guide

Teaching Engine 2.0 follows the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) guidelines for comprehensive, student-centered planning.

## The ETFO Planning Framework

### Five Levels of Planning

ETFO recommends a hierarchical approach to planning that ensures comprehensive curriculum coverage while maintaining flexibility for student needs.

#### 1. Long-Range Plans (Yearly Overview)
**Purpose**: Provide the "big picture" view of learning across the entire school year

**Key Components**:
- **Overall and Specific Expectations**: Direct curriculum connections
- **Big Ideas**: Overarching concepts that connect learning
- **Essential Questions**: Drive inquiry and engagement
- **Assessment Plans**: How learning will be measured
- **Timeline**: Realistic pacing throughout the year

**ETFO Guidelines**:
- Balance all curriculum areas appropriately
- Include cross-curricular connections
- Plan for assessment of and for learning
- Consider school and community contexts

#### 2. Unit Plans (Multi-Week Learning Sequences)
**Purpose**: Organize related learning experiences into coherent units

**Key Components**:
- **Unit Goals**: What students will know, do, and understand
- **Learning Experiences**: Sequence of lessons and activities
- **Assessment Strategies**: Variety of assessment methods
- **Resources**: Materials, texts, technology, community connections
- **Differentiation**: Accommodations and modifications

**ETFO Guidelines**:
- Units should be 2-4 weeks in length
- Include minds-on, action, and consolidation phases
- Provide multiple ways for students to demonstrate learning
- Connect to students' lives and interests

#### 3. Lesson Plans (Individual Learning Experiences)
**Purpose**: Detail specific learning experiences and instructional strategies

**Three-Part Lesson Structure** (ETFO Recommended):

**Minds On** (5-15 minutes):
- Activate prior knowledge
- Generate interest and curiosity
- Set learning goals
- Make connections to previous learning

**Action** (20-40 minutes):
- Main learning experience
- New concept introduction
- Guided and independent practice
- Collaborative learning opportunities

**Consolidation** (5-15 minutes):
- Reflect on learning
- Make connections
- Assess understanding
- Preview next steps

#### 4. Daily Planning (Day-to-Day Adjustments)
**Purpose**: Responsive adjustments based on student needs and learning

**Key Elements**:
- Observation notes
- Student self-assessments
- Informal assessment data
- Next-day planning adjustments
- Resource needs

#### 5. Assessment and Evaluation
**Purpose**: Monitor and report on student learning

**Three Types of Assessment**:
- **Assessment FOR Learning**: Ongoing feedback to improve learning
- **Assessment AS Learning**: Student self-assessment and reflection
- **Assessment OF Learning**: Evaluation for reporting purposes

## ETFO Assessment Framework

### Assessment FOR Learning (Formative)
**Purpose**: Improve student learning during the learning process

**Strategies**:
