# Unit Plans

Unit plans are the detailed breakdown of your long-range plan themes into manageable, focused learning experiences. They bridge the gap between yearly overview and daily lessons.

## What Makes a Strong Unit Plan?

A well-designed unit plan includes:
- **Clear learning goals** aligned with curriculum expectations
- **Success criteria** that students can understand
- **Assessment strategies** both formative and summative
- **Differentiation plans** for diverse learners
- **Resource lists** and material requirements
- **Culminating activities** that synthesize learning

## The ETFO Unit Planning Process

### Step 1: Unpack Curriculum Expectations
1. Review the expectations assigned from your long-range plan
2. Identify the key concepts, skills, and big ideas
3. Use the AI to suggest learning progressions
4. Consider prerequisite knowledge and skills

### Step 2: Design Assessment
Plan assessment **before** designing learning activities:
- **Diagnostic**: What do students already know?
- **Formative**: How will you monitor progress during learning?
- **Summative**: How will students demonstrate final understanding?

### Step 3: Plan Learning Experiences
- Start with the end in mind (culminating activity)
- Design a variety of learning experiences
- Include multiple modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Plan for active learning and student engagement

### Step 4: Organize Resources and Materials
- List all required materials and resources
- Plan for technology integration
- Prepare differentiated materials
- Set up learning environments

## Key Components Explained

### Learning Goals and Success Criteria

**Learning Goals** answer "What will students learn?"
- Written in student-friendly language
- Based directly on curriculum expectations
- Focused on understanding, not just activities

**Success Criteria** answer "How will we know they've learned it?"
- Observable and measurable
- Co-created with students when possible
- Used for self and peer assessment

Example:
```
Learning Goal: Students will understand how living things adapt to their environment.

Success Criteria:
- I can identify specific adaptations in plants and animals
- I can explain how adaptations help survival
- I can predict what adaptations might be needed in different environments
```

### Differentiation Strategies

Plan for three types of differentiation:

**Content Differentiation**
- Varied reading levels
- Multiple information sources
- Choice in topics or examples

**Process Differentiation**
- Different ways to work with information
- Varied grouping strategies
- Multiple learning modalities

**Product Differentiation**
- Choice in how to demonstrate learning
- Varied assessment formats
- Different complexity levels

### Three-Part Lesson Structure

Each lesson within your unit should follow:

**Minds On (10-15 minutes)**
- Activate prior knowledge
- Introduce the day's learning
- Engage student interest

**Action (30-40 minutes)**
- Core learning activities
- Guided and independent practice
- Teacher observation and feedback

**Consolidation (10-15 minutes)**
- Summarize key learning
- Make connections
- Preview next steps

## Using AI for Unit Planning

The AI assistant can help you:
- **Generate activity ideas** based on your learning goals
- **Suggest assessment strategies** appropriate for the content
- **Create differentiated materials** for various learning needs
- **Plan cross-curricular connections** with other subjects
- **Develop rubrics and checklists** for assessment

### Effective AI Prompts for Unit Planning

```
"Create 5 engaging activities for Grade 3 students to learn about plant adaptations, including hands-on, visual, and technology-based options."

"Suggest formative assessment strategies for a Grade 5 unit on fractions that can be used during daily lessons."

"Design a culminating activity for a Grade 2 community helpers unit that allows for student choice and multiple ways to demonstrate learning."
```

## Assessment and Evaluation

### Types of Assessment

**Diagnostic Assessment**
- Pre-unit surveys or discussions
- KWL charts (Know, Want to know, Learned)
- Quick skills checks
- Review of prerequisite concepts

**Formative Assessment**
- Exit tickets
- Thumbs up/down checks
- Mini-whiteboards
- Observation checklists
- Peer feedback

**Summative Assessment**
- Unit tests or quizzes
- Performance tasks
- Projects or presentations
- Portfolios of work

### Creating Effective Rubrics

Good rubrics:
- Align directly with learning goals
- Use clear, specific language
- Include multiple performance levels
- Focus on learning, not just compliance
- Can be understood by students

## Cross-Curricular Connections

Look for natural ways to connect your unit with:
- **Language Arts**: Reading, writing, speaking, listening
- **Mathematics**: Real-world problem solving and data
- **Science and Technology**: Inquiry and investigation
- **Social Studies**: Community connections and citizenship
- **Arts**: Creative expression and communication
- **Health and Physical Education**: Active learning and wellness

## Timing and Pacing

### Typical Unit Length
- **Primary (K-3)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Junior (4-6)**: 3-4 weeks
- **Intermediate (7-8)**: 4-6 weeks

### Pacing Considerations
- Allow extra time for complex concepts
- Build in review and consolidation days
- Plan for unexpected interruptions
- Include buffer days for extension or catch-up

## Common Unit Planning Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Activity-Focused Planning
**Problem**: Planning fun activities without clear learning goals
**Solution**: Start with curriculum expectations, then design activities

### Mistake 2: One-Size-Fits-All Approach
**Problem**: Not considering diverse learning needs
**Solution**: Plan differentiation from the beginning

### Mistake 3: Assessment as an Afterthought
**Problem**: Adding assessment after planning activities
**Solution**: Design assessment before planning learning experiences

### Mistake 4: Isolated Learning
**Problem**: Units that don't connect to other learning
**Solution**: Plan cross-curricular connections and real-world applications

## Unit Plan Templates

Teaching Engine 2.0 provides:
- **Subject-specific templates** for each curriculum area
- **Grade-appropriate formats** based on student developmental levels
- **ETFO-aligned structures** following best practices
- **Customizable layouts** to match your school's requirements

## Quality Indicators

Strong unit plans demonstrate:
- Clear alignment with curriculum expectations
- Appropriate challenge level for students
- Variety in learning experiences and assessments
- Explicit differentiation strategies
- Logical sequence and pacing
- Connection to real-world applications
- Evidence of student voice and choice

## Reflection and Improvement

After each unit, reflect on:
- What worked well?
- What would you change?
- How did students respond?
- What resources were most effective?
- How was the timing and pacing?
- What connections did students make?

Use these reflections to improve future unit plans and share insights with colleagues.

Remember: Great unit plans provide structure while remaining flexible enough to respond to student needs and interests as they emerge!
