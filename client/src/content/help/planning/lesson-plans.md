# Lesson Plans

Lesson plans are the detailed daily implementation of your unit plans, following the proven three-part lesson structure that maximizes student engagement and learning.

## The Three-Part Lesson Structure

ETFO-aligned lesson plans follow a consistent structure that supports effective learning:

### Minds On (10-15 minutes)
**Purpose**: Activate prior knowledge and engage students in the day's learning

**Key Activities**:
- Review previous learning and connections
- Introduce the learning goal and success criteria
- Activate student interest and curiosity
- Set the context for new learning

**Example Strategies**:
- Quick think-pair-share about prior knowledge
- Gallery walk of student work from yesterday
- Real-world problem or scenario introduction
- Visual or video hook to spark curiosity

### Action (30-40 minutes) 
**Purpose**: Core learning activities where students engage with new content

**Key Activities**:
- Guided instruction and modeling
- Collaborative learning activities
- Independent practice and application
- Ongoing formative assessment

**Teaching Strategies**:
- **Direct Instruction**: Mini-lessons and explicit teaching
- **Guided Practice**: Gradual release of responsibility
- **Independent Work**: Application and consolidation
- **Collaborative Learning**: Peer interaction and support

### Consolidation (10-15 minutes)
**Purpose**: Summarize learning and make connections

**Key Activities**:
- Summarize key concepts and skills
- Make connections to bigger learning goals
- Reflect on the learning process
- Preview upcoming learning

**Effective Strategies**:
- Exit tickets with key questions
- Student sharing of learning highlights
- Connection to unit learning goals

### Effective AI Prompting for Lessons

**Specific Prompts Work Best**
```
Instead of: "Create a math lesson"
Try: "Create a 50-minute Grade 4 lesson on comparing fractions using hands-on manipulatives, including differentiation for struggling learners"
```

**Include Context and Constraints**
```
"Design a Grade 2 writing lesson on personal narratives that uses technology, accommodates students with fine motor challenges, and connects to our community helpers unit"
```

**Ask for Multiple Options**
```
"Suggest 3 different consolidation activities for a Grade 6 science lesson on simple machines, ranging from individual reflection to collaborative creation"
```

**Request Specific Components**
```
"Create success criteria for a Grade 3 art lesson where students will design and create a collage showing their family traditions"
```

## Differentiation in Daily Lessons
