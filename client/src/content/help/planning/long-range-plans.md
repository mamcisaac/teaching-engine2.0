# Long-Range Plans

Long-range plans form the foundation of the ETFO-aligned planning hierarchy in Teaching Engine 2.0. They provide the year-long overview that guides all subsequent planning decisions.

## What are Long-Range Plans?

Long-range plans are comprehensive yearly overviews that:
- Organize curriculum expectations by subject and strand
- Map out major units and themes across the school year
- Establish learning progressions and connections
- Plan for assessment and evaluation opportunities
- Consider special events, holidays, and school calendar

## Creating Your First Long-Range Plan

### Step 1: Set Up Your Plan Structure
1. Navigate to **Long-Range Plans** in the ETFO workflow
2. Click **Create New Plan**
3. Select your grade level and subjects
4. Choose your school year dates

### Step 2: Import Curriculum Expectations
- Use the **Curriculum Import** feature to automatically load Ontario curriculum expectations
- Review and organize expectations by subject and strand
- The AI will suggest logical groupings and sequences

### Step 3: Plan Your Units
- Create 4-6 major units per subject
- Assign curriculum expectations to each unit
- Set approximate timing for each unit
- Consider cross-curricular connections

### Step 4: Review and Refine
- Use the **Curriculum Coverage** view to ensure complete coverage
- Adjust timing based on your school calendar
- Share with colleagues for feedback

## Best Practices

### Timing Considerations
- **September**: Start with community building and diagnostic assessment
- **October-November**: Establish routines and begin core curriculum
- **December**: Plan for holiday breaks and shorter attention spans
- **January-March**: Core learning period with consistent instruction
- **April-May**: Consolidation and enrichment activities
- **June**: Culminating activities and transitions

### Cross-Curricular Planning
- Look for natural connections between subjects
- Plan themed units that integrate multiple subjects
- Use big ideas and essential questions to guide connections
- Consider real-world applications and project-based learning

### Assessment Planning
- Build in diagnostic assessment at the beginning
- Plan formative assessments throughout each unit
- Schedule summative assessments at logical intervals
- Include both formal and informal assessment opportunities

## Using AI to Enhance Long-Range Plans

Teaching Engine 2.0's AI can help you:
- **Suggest unit sequences** based on curriculum requirements
- **Identify connections** between different subject areas
- **Recommend timing** for different topics based on student development
- **Generate assessment ideas** aligned with your learning goals
- **Create resource lists** for each unit

### AI Prompting Tips for Long-Range Planning
- Be specific about your grade level and context
- Include any school-specific requirements or constraints
- Ask for multiple options to choose from
- Request both traditional and innovative approaches

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Too Much Content, Too Little Time
**Solution**: Use the priority ranking feature to identify essential vs. enrichment content. Focus on depth over breadth for core concepts.

### Challenge: Lack of Resources
**Solution**: Use AI-generated resource suggestions and collaborate with colleagues to share materials. The resource library will grow over time.

### Challenge: Uncertain Timing
**Solution**: Build in flexibility with buffer weeks and optional extension activities. The AI can suggest realistic timeframes based on similar contexts.

### Challenge: Student Needs Unknown
**Solution**: Plan for differentiation from the start. Include diagnostic assessments early and build in adjustment points throughout the year.

## Integration with Other Planning Levels

Your long-range plan connects to:
- **Unit Plans**: Detailed breakdown of each unit
- **Lesson Plans**: Daily implementation of unit goals
- **Weekly Planning**: Scheduling and resource preparation
- **Daybook**: Daily reflection and adjustment

## Review and Revision

Long-range plans are living documents:
- Review monthly and adjust as needed
- Note successful strategies for next year
- Track curriculum coverage and pacing
- Gather feedback from students and colleagues
- Use end-of-year reflection to improve future plans

## Templates and Examples

Teaching Engine 2.0 provides:
- **Grade-specific templates** based on ETFO best practices
- **Subject-specific frameworks** for different curriculum areas
- **Sample plans** from experienced Ontario teachers
