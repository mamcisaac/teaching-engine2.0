## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Template Doesn't Fit My Style
**Solution**: Remember templates are starting points. Modify formatting, language, and structure to match your approach while maintaining the pedagogical framework.

### Students Need Different Supports
**Solution**: Use the differentiation sections to adapt for diverse learners. Add visual supports, modify language complexity, or include additional scaffolding.

### Not Enough Time for All Components
**Solution**: Prioritize essential elements and spread activities across multiple days. Templates can be adapted for different time allocations.

### Technology Integration Challenges
**Solution**: Adapt digital elements for available technology or create analog alternatives. Focus on pedagogical goals rather than specific tools.

Remember: ETFO templates are designed to support your professional judgment, not replace it. Use them as foundations to build upon with your expertise, creativity, and knowledge of your students.
