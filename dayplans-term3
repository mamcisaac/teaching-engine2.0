Below is a **five-day, cross-curricular day-plan set for Week 1 of Term 3 (Mon Mar 24 – Fri Mar 28)**.
Each plan shows:

* **Daily “why” statement** (outcome link)
* **Schedule blocks** with learning targets & key steps
* **Materials & prep** (minimal class-time surprises)
* **Assessment touch-points & differentiation**

Everything aligns with the PEI Grade 1 French-Immersion outcomes and the Week 1 milestones you approved earlier.

It builds directly on last week’s routines and hits the week-level targets you approved earlier:

* extend **“small-moment” narrative writing** with French adjectives of colour / size,
* develop **skip-counting by 5s & 10s to 100** through calendar-math and centres,
* begin **quantitative bean-growth tracking** in centimetres,
* explore **needs & services in the school community** (custodian, admin, etc.),
* practise **pedestrian safety** ahead of the spring walkabout, and
* create a **painted colour-mixing wheel** that reinforces primary→secondary hues.

Key resources are hyper-linked in the citations for turnkey prep.

Below is a fully-scaffolded five-day plan for **Week 3 of Term 3 — Monday 7 April to Friday 11 April**.
The week deepens narrative fluency through a French reader’s-theatre, introduces **open-number-line strategies for addition/subtraction to 20**, launches the **butterfly habitat inquiry** while comparing *ovipares* and *vivipares*, revisits **goods vs services** with a “mini-marché”, refreshes **hand-washing & cough etiquette**, and explores form through **papier-mâché egg sculptures**. All activities align with the PEI Grade 1 outcomes and build directly on Weeks 1-2 foundations.

Below are **day-by-day plans for the remainder of Term 3**—Weeks 7 through 12—so you now have a complete daily skeleton for the year.
Timings follow the same rhythm you’ve been using (8 :30 – 2 :00 with two core morning blocks, two 45-min mid-morning blocks, and two afternoon blocks).
For brevity, materials common to multiple days (chart paper, iPads, manipulatives, scissors, glue) are assumed to be on your Running Supply List and are not repeated.
