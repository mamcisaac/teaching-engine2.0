# Agent Implementation Guide - Teaching Engine 2.0

## ü§ñ Overview for Autonomous Agents

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for AI coding agents implementing phases 4 and 5 of the Teaching Engine 2.0 project. The system is a curriculum planning tool for elementary teachers that needs to evolve from its current MVP state (phases 0-3 complete) into a fully-featured planning assistant.

## üéØ Project Context

### What This System Does
Teaching Engine 2.0 is a "digital teaching assistant" that consolidates all aspects of elementary curriculum planning:
- **Curriculum Mapping**: Organize yearly teaching goals into subjects, milestones, and activities
- **Weekly Planning**: Intelligent scheduling of activities based on timetable and pacing
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of curriculum coverage with adaptive suggestions
- **Resource Management**: Centralized storage and preparation lists for teaching materials
- **Parent Communication**: Automated newsletter generation from completed activities
- **Emergency Preparedness**: Quick substitute teacher plan generation

### Current State (Phases 0-3 Complete)
- ‚úÖ Full CRUD API for Subjects, Milestones, and Activities
- ‚úÖ React UI with forms, lists, and progress visualization
- ‚úÖ SQLite database with Prisma ORM
- ‚úÖ Docker deployment ready
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (Jest, Vitest, Playwright)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/mamcisaac/teaching-engine2.0.git
cd teaching-engine2.0
pnpm install

# For Codex/AI agents
bash scripts/codex-setup.sh

# Start development
pnpm run dev
```

### 2. Branch Strategy
```bash
# Phase 4 features
git checkout -b feat/4a-weekly-planner
git checkout -b feat/4b-resource-upload
git checkout -b feat/4c-progress-alerts

# Phase 5 features
git checkout -b feat/5-curriculum-intelligence
```

### 3. Development Process
1. **Write failing test first** (TDD approach)
2. **Implement feature** following existing patterns
3. **Ensure all tests pass**: `pnpm test && pnpm lint && pnpm build`
4. **Commit atomically** with conventional commits
5. **Open PR** with checklist template

### 4. Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, explicit types, no `any`
- **React**: Functional components with hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind utilities only (no custom CSS)
- **State**: TanStack Query for server state, useState for UI state
- **Testing**: 90%+ coverage for new features

## üìã Phase 4 Implementation Details

### 4.1 Weekly Planner Automation

**Goal**: Intelligent activity suggestions based on curriculum pacing and teacher preferences.

**Database Schema Changes**:
```prisma
model LessonPlan {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  weekStart  DateTime
  activities Activity[]
  createdAt  DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime   @updatedAt
}

model TeacherPreferences {
  id              Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  teachingStyles  String // JSON array
  pacePreference  String // "aggressive" | "balanced" | "relaxed"
  prepTime        Int    // minutes per week available
}
```

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/lesson-plans/generate` - Create weekly suggestions
- `GET /api/lesson-plans/:weekStart` - Retrieve plan for specific week
- `PUT /api/lesson-plans/:id` - Update/finalize plan
- `POST /api/preferences` - Save teacher preferences

**Frontend Components**:
- `WeeklyPlannerPage.tsx` - Main planner interface
- `ActivitySuggestionList.tsx` - Draggable activity cards
- `WeekCalendarGrid.tsx` - Drop zones for scheduling
- `AutoFillButton.tsx` - One-click optimal scheduling

**Algorithm Requirements**:
1. Consider milestone deadlines and current progress
2. Balance subjects according to timetable
3. Respect teaching style preferences
4. Account for activity dependencies
5. Leave buffer time for assessments

### 4.2 Resource Management

**Goal**: Centralized file storage and material preparation tracking.

**Infrastructure**:
- Local file storage: `server/uploads/` directory
- S3 integration: AWS SDK with presigned URLs
- File metadata in database

**Database Schema**:
```prisma
model Resource {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  filename   String
  url        String
  type       String   // "document" | "image" | "video"
  size       Int
  activityId Int?
  activity   Activity? @relation(fields: [activityId], references: [id])
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
}

model MaterialList {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  weekStart  DateTime
  items      String   // JSON array
  prepared   Boolean  @default(false)
}
```

**Features**:
- Drag-and-drop file upload with progress
- Automatic PDF generation for printables
- Material checklist generation from activities
- Bulk download for weekly resources

### 4.3 Progress Alerts

**Goal**: Proactive notifications when curriculum pacing is off-track.

**Implementation**:
- Cron job: Daily progress check at 6 AM
- Email service: Resend or SendGrid integration
- In-app notifications: Toast messages

**Alert Triggers**:
- Milestone deadline approaching (1 week) with <80% completion
- Subject significantly behind yearly pace (>2 weeks)
- No activities marked complete in 5+ days
- Upcoming milestone with no scheduled activities

### 4.4 Newsletter Generator

**Goal**: Auto-draft parent communications from activity data.

**Features**:
- Template system with placeholders
- Activity summaries by subject
- Photo integration from resources
- Multiple export formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML)

**API**: `POST /api/newsletters/generate`
```json
{
  "startDate": "2024-01-01",
  "endDate": "2024-01-31",
  "template": "monthly",
  "includePhotos": true
}
```

## üß† Phase 5 Implementation Details

### 5.1 Curriculum Intelligence Overview

**Goal**: AI-powered curriculum mapping from official PEI standards.

**Data Sources**:
- PEI curriculum PDFs (Math, Science, Language Arts, etc.)
- Provincial learning outcomes database
- School calendar API for holidays

### 5.2 ETL Pipeline

```typescript
// Extract
const extractOutcomes = async (pdfPath: string): Promise<Outcome[]> => {
  const data = await pdfParse(pdfPath);
  return parseOutcomes(data.text);
};

// Transform with embeddings
const clusterOutcomes = async (outcomes: Outcome[]): Promise<Milestone[]> => {
  const embeddings = await openai.createEmbedding({
    model: "text-embedding-3-small",
    input: outcomes.map(o => o.text)
  });
  return kMeansClustering(embeddings, 8); // 8 milestones per subject
};

// Load
const generateCurriculum = async (clustered: Milestone[]): Promise<void> => {
  await prisma.subject.create({
    data: {
      name: "Mathematics Grade 1",
      milestones: {
        create: clustered
      }
    }
  });
};
```

### 5.3 Setup Wizard UI

**Flow**:
1. Select grade level
2. Choose subjects to import
3. Configure pacing preferences
4. Review generated curriculum
5. Customize before saving

**Components**:
- `CurriculumWizard.tsx` - Multi-step form
- `OutcomeTree.tsx` - Hierarchical outcome display
