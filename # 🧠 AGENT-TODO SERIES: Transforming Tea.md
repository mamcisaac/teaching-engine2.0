# ðŸ§  AGENT-TODO SERIES: Transforming Teaching-Engine 2.0 into Curriculum-Aligned Planning App

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

Restructure Teaching-Engine 2.0 to fully implement the ETFO-style planning model described in _Planning for Student Learning_. This includes five distinct planning levels (Curriculum Expectations â†’ Long-Range Plans â†’ Unit Plans â†’ Lesson Plans â†’ Daybook Entries), structured data models, AI-supported workflows, and a streamlined UI aligned to the bookâ€™s templates.
