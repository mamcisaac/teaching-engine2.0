Here are a dozen “big-picture” checkpoints teams often forget to flag until they’re staring at a crowded calendar.  You may have handled many already—it’s just a final sweep before Term 2 rolls into Term 3.

| Lens                                   | Why it matters                                                             | Quick self-audit prompts                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **School-wide calendar sync**          | Assemblies, concerts, skating days and intramurals regularly steal blocks. | • Do any weekly plans land on a *known* PD day, lock-down drill, or field trip?<br>• Have you budgeted one “cushion” block per week for inevitable disruptions?                               |
| **Specialist timetables**              | Music / Phys-Ed / Library often change in January.                         | • Do your minute-by-minute grids dovetail with next-term prep times?<br>• Have you built in transit time to and from the gym/library?                                                         |
| **Assessment/report windows**          | Mid-year report card cut-off usually sits \~2 weeks before issue date.     | • Are running-records, math quizzes, science rubrics *scored* (not just administered) before data entry locks?                                                                                |
| **Inclusion & supports**               | IEP, EAL pull-outs, SLP blocks can collide with core lessons.              | • Which high-cognitive-load mini-lessons clash with known pull-out times?<br>• Do your procedural/visual supports meet UDL guidelines (icons, bilingual cues)?                                |
| **Indigenous & cultural perspectives** | Required by PEI curricula across strands.                                  | • Beyond the Mi’kmaq double-curve, are Indigenous voices present in read-alouds, science examples, citizenship talks?<br>• February — African Heritage Month resources aligned?               |
| **Family communication cadence**       | Predictable updates calm inbox load.                                       | • Do you want a *Term 2 mid-point* newsletter summarising light/sound inquiry + coin market?<br>• Video/privacy permissions in place for the many Seesaw uploads?                             |
| **Budget / consumables**               | Clay, LED tea-lights, sugar cubes, bind-spines add up.                     | • Cross-check consumable lists against remaining classroom budget or PAC reimbursement windows.<br>• Any bulk order needs at least two weeks’ lead time.                                      |
| **Tech & device logistics**            | Shared tablets book up fast near progress-report season.                   | • Are poster-fair videos and choral-reading rehearsals booked in library cart schedule?<br>• Headphones sanitised for sound-poster recordings?                                                |
| **Health & safety**                    | Winter = germs & icy field trips.                                          | • Hypothermia and helmet lessons are in—but have you penned blanket permission / waiver for outdoor rink?<br>• Stock of tissues, sanitiser, UV‐lotion still healthy after germ-glitter demos? |
| **Fire-code / hallway display limits** | Fire-marshals dislike paper avalanches.                                    | • Clay creatures + double-curve paintings + snow-track banners: do they exceed 20 % wall-coverage rule?<br>• Can some pieces rotate to library showcase instead?                              |
| **Student voice & agency**             | Builds motivation before spring slump.                                     | • Do Term-3 life-cycle centres allow “choose-your-seed” options?<br>• Can math carnival booths be co-designed by students?                                                                    |
| **Flex / reflection buffer**           | Overplanning is worse than under-planning if there’s no slack.             | • One *empty* 15-minute slot per day—kept for spill-over, restorative circle, or just breathing?                                                                                              |

### Final nudge

1. **Plot everything on a single year-at-a-glance wall calendar**—colour-code academics, events, and assessment checkpoints.
2. **Review with your grade-level partner & the resource teacher**; they’ll spot pull-out collisions faster than any spreadsheet.
3. **Keep a living “trim-or-stretch” list** of low-stake centres that can disappear on a snow-delay day or expand when an assembly is cancelled.

If those boxes are ticked, your Term 2-3 roadmap is about as bullet-proof—and student-centred—as it gets.  Happy teaching!
