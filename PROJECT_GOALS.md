# Teaching Engine 2.0 - Project Goals & Intentions

## üéØ Core Mission

Teaching Engine 2.0 is designed to be the **ultimate digital teaching assistant** for elementary school teachers. Our goal is to reduce teacher workload by 60% while improving curriculum coverage and student outcomes through intelligent automation and planning tools.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Philosophy

### Intentional Design Decisions

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**

   - Every feature must reduce teacher workload, not add to it
   - UI should be intuitive for non-technical users
   - One-click solutions preferred over multi-step processes

2. **Data-Driven Intelligence**

   - All suggestions based on actual curriculum data
   - Progress tracking drives automated recommendations
   - Real-time adaptation to teaching pace and style

3. **Professional Integration**

   - Seamless fit into existing teacher workflows
   - Export capabilities for standard formats (PDF, DOCX)
   - Emergency preparedness built into core functionality

4. **Reliability First**
   - 99.9% uptime target
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
   - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## ü§ñ Agent Development Guidelines

### For AI Coding Agents Working on This Project

#### Core Principles

1. **Teacher-First Thinking**: Every decision should make teachers' lives easier
2. **Data Integrity**: Never compromise on data accuracy or loss prevention
3. **Performance Awareness**: Teachers work on older hardware with slower internet
4. **Accessibility**: Many teachers have varying technical abilities

#### Implementation Standards

1. **Always Write Tests First**: TDD approach prevents regressions
2. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Study current code before adding new patterns
3. **Document Decisions**: Update this file with architectural choices
4. **Validate with Real Data**: Use realistic teacher scenarios for testing

#### Quality Gates

- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors (`pnpm build`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] E2E tests cover new user workflows
- [ ] Performance impact measured and documented
- [ ] Accessibility tested with screen reader

#### Communication Requirements

- Update agent logs (`AGENT-[NAME]-LOG.md`) with progress
- Create detailed commit messages following conventional commits
- Document any deviations from this guide with rationale
- Flag any unclear requirements for human review

### Agent Coordination

Multiple agents may work on this project simultaneously. To prevent conflicts:

1. **Claim Features**: Update AGENTS-TODO.md when starting work
2. **Communicate Changes**: Log database schema changes immediately
3. **Share Learning**: Document patterns that other agents should follow
4. **Merge Carefully**: Always pull latest before pushing changes
