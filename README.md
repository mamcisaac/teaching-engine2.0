## API

### Calendar Events

- `POST /api/calendar-events/sync/ical` – Import an external iCal feed. Each
  event from the feed is stored as a holiday `CalendarEvent`.

### Report Deadlines

- `GET /api/report-deadlines?teacherId=` – List deadlines for a teacher.
- `POST /api/report-deadlines` – Create a new deadline.
- `PUT /api/report-deadlines/:id` – Update an existing deadline.
- `DELETE /api/report-deadlines/:id` – Remove a deadline.

### Curriculum Outcomes

- `GET /api/outcomes` – List all curriculum outcomes.
- `GET /api/outcomes?subject=FRA&grade=1` – Filter outcomes by subject and grade.
- `GET /api/outcomes?search=keyword` – Search outcomes by code or description.

### ETFO Planning

- `GET /api/curriculum-expectations` – Get curriculum expectations with filtering
- `GET /api/long-range-plans` – List long-range plans
- `GET /api/unit-plans` – List unit plans
- `GET /api/etfo-lesson-plans` – List ETFO lesson plans
- `GET /api/daybook-entries` – Get daybook entries and analytics

### AI Suggestions

- `GET /api/ai-suggestions` – List AI-generated activity suggestions.
- `POST /api/ai-suggestions` – Create a new AI activity suggestion for an outcome.
- `PUT /api/ai-suggestions/:id` – Update an existing suggestion.
- `DELETE /api/ai-suggestions/:id` – Remove a suggestion.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Set up test environment
cp server/.env.test.example server/.env.test

# Unit tests
pnpm run test

# E2E tests
pnpm run test:e2e

# All tests with coverage
pnpm run test:all
```

Unit tests cover the iCal import logic and integration tests ensure the
`/api/report-deadlines` CRUD endpoints behave correctly.

If the automatic Playwright installation fails (e.g., due to restricted `sudo` access in CI), install browsers and dependencies manually:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install-deps
pnpm exec playwright install
```

## 📋 Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Create subjects for your curriculum (Math, Science, Language Arts, etc.)
   - Import provincial curriculum standards or use AI to parse curriculum documents

2. **Create Long-Range Plans**: Define major curriculum areas and yearly goals
   - Link curriculum expectations to long-range planning objectives

3. **Develop Unit Plans**: Break down long-range goals into manageable units
   - Organize expectations thematically or by learning progression
   - Set unit timelines and assessment strategies

4. **Plan Lessons**: Create specific lesson plans within units
   - Use AI planning assistance for content generation
   - Link visual resources and materials

5. **Track Progress**: 
   - Create daybook entries to reflect on lesson effectiveness
   - Monitor curriculum coverage through analytics
   - Review trends in teaching and learning

6. **Communicate**: 
   - Generate bilingual parent newsletters from completed activities
   - Export in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, Markdown)
   - Manage all communications from one hub

### Key Concepts

- **Long-Range Plans**: Yearly planning documents covering major curriculum areas  
- **Unit Plans**: Thematic units organizing expectations into logical teaching sequences
- **Lesson Plans**: Daily lessons with specific activities, materials, and assessments
- **Daybook Entries**: Daily reflections tracking teaching effectiveness and student progress

## 🤝 Development Guidelines

This project follows strict development standards:

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Study the codebase for coding style and architecture
2. **Maintain Test Coverage**: Write tests before implementation (TDD approach) - target 90%+ coverage
3. **Use Conventional Commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
4. **Branch Strategy**: Create feature branches for all development
5. **Atomic Commits**: Small, focused commits that pass all tests
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with each feature
7. **TypeScript**: Strict mode with no `any` types
8. **Performance**: Measure impact of all changes

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Rate limiting on API routes (Phase 4)
- Efficient database queries with Prisma
