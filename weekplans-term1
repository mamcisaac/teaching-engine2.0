Below is a **day-by-day “skeleton” for every instructional week in Term 1 (Week 1 = Sept 2 – 5 to Week 12 = Nov 17 – 21).**
Each grid keeps to the rhythm you used for Term 3:

* **Morning greeting / warm-up**
* **Block A – French Language Arts**
* **Block B – Mathematics**
* **Block C – Science / Social Studies**
* **Block D – Health or Arts**

> **How to read the grid**
> • Each cell gives the **mini-lesson focus** + 1-2 key activities and a quick check for evidence.
> • Materials that repeat every day (whiteboards, markers, counters, scissors, glue, iPads) live on your Running Supply List.
> • “✓” marks an embedded formative check (exit ticket, anecdotal note, photo).

### Using the skeleton

* **Plug-and-play** – drop your read-alouds, maths games, and centres straight into the labelled blocks.
* **Assessment ready** – running-records Weeks 4 & 11, math fact quizzes most Fridays, and science portfolios Week 11 give you all the evidence you need for the November progress report.
* **Flex room** – each afternoon block can be shortened or swapped to accommodate assemblies, field trips, or guest speakers without losing a core outcome.

With Term 1 now mapped to the daily level, you have a full-year framework — Terms 1 through 3 — ready for detailed lesson slides, centre bins, and substitute plans. Happy planning!





Below are **detailed day-by-day plans for the first six instructional weeks of Term 1 (Tuesday 2 Sept – Friday 10 Oct)**.
Each week is presented in a single table (rows = days, columns = core blocks).  The format matches the “Week-at-a-glance” you liked for Term 3:

* **Greeting / French Language Arts (FLA)** – phonemic focus, shared/guided reading, early writing
* **Mathematics** – counting, patterns, early operations
* **Science / Social Studies** – inquiry or community focus
* **Health / Visual Arts** – well-being & creative exploration
* ✓ = embedded formative checkpoint (exit ticket, anecdotal note, photo)

> **Daily schedule template** (all weeks)
> • 08 :30 – 08 :45  Greeting/chant/warm-up • 08 :45 – 09 :25  Block A • 09 :30 – 10 :10  Block B
> • 10 :25 – 11 :05  Block C • 12 :45 – 13 :25  Block D1 • 13 :25 – 14 :00  Block D2
