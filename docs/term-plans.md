Below is a **week-by-week roadmap for Term 1 (12 instructional weeks, early September – late November) in Grade 1 Early French Immersion on Prince Edward Island.**
Each entry names the _main skills, concepts, anchor texts/activities,_ and _assessment touch-points_ for every subject so that daily lesson plans can later be fleshed out quickly.

## Quick orientation — how to read this grid

- **French LA** strands appear in the order _Oral → Reading → Writing_ each week.
- **Anchor resources** include the provincial “Décode” decodable readers and other levelled books.
- **Micro-assessments** (✓) are timed so evidence is collected before the November progress report.
- Content is aligned with the PEI Grade 1 outcomes for every subject area.

## Embedded assessments & evidence collection

- **Running records** Weeks 4 & 11 document decoding growth ([teacherspayteachers.com][8], [ca.ixl.com][10])
- **Performance tasks** (toy build, season wheel, skits) target applied knowledge in science, social studies and language ([princeedwardisland.ca][4], [princeedwardisland.ca][11])
- **Quick checks** (dictées, math fact games, safety symbol match-ups) meet provincial formative-assessment guidance ([princeedwardisland.ca][5], [princeedwardisland.ca][9])

## Next steps

With this skeleton, you can now drop in **daily centres, mini-lessons, read-aloud titles, and rotations** while knowing exactly which outcome every activity advances. The timing also leaves room for school-wide events and unforeseen interruptions without sacrificing the provincial milestones for Term 1.

Below is a **12-week roadmap for Term 2 (December 1 – March 7, excluding the two-week Winter Break and the one-week March Break) in Grade 1 Early French Immersion on Prince Edward Island.**
It extends the trajectory you set in Term 1, matching the provincial outcome documents for French Immersion Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Health, and Visual Arts. Key phonics targets, math strands, inquiry questions, and assessment checkpoints are sequenced so you can later drop in daily mini-lessons and centres with confidence.
