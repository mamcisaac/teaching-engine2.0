## 🤖 For AI Coding Agents

### Getting Started
1. Read the **[AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md](../AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md)** for specific guidance
2. Review **[ENHANCEMENT_FEATURES.md](./ENHANCEMENT_FEATURES.md)** for approved work
3. Check GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
4. Follow the development setup in **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)**

### Key Principles
- The project is **feature-complete** - focus on enhancements and fixes
- Maintain **backward compatibility** at all times
- Write **comprehensive tests** (90%+ coverage)
- Update **documentation** with any changes

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Common Issues

- **Database sync issues**: `pnpm --filter @teaching-engine/database db:generate`
- **Database migrations**: `pnpm --filter @teaching-engine/database db:migrate`
- **Port conflicts**: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
- **Test failures**: Check Node version matches CI requirements

### Support Resources

- Review existing code patterns in `server/src/routes/` and `client/src/components/`
- Check recent commit history for implementation examples
- Consult the architectural patterns throughout the codebase
- Study the test suite for expected behaviors

## 🌟 Remember

**The goal is achieved** - Teaching Engine 2.0 successfully helps teachers reduce their workload by 60%+. Any new work should enhance this success without compromising the existing functionality.

**Success continues to look like**: Teachers saying "I can't imagine teaching without Teaching Engine 2.0" and meaning it from their heart.
