## ⏳ What Remains

### Frontend UI Components
1. **ETFOLessonPlanPage** - Individual lesson planning interface
2. **DaybookPage** - Daily reflection and print-ready views
3. **CurriculumExpectationsPage** - Browse and manage expectations
4. **Enhanced navigation** - Add Unit Plans to sidebar

### AI Integration (Phase E)
1. Create `aiDraftService.ts`
2. Long-range plan generation

4. Lesson plan draft generation
5. Daybook/substitute bundles

### Migration Execution
1. Feature flag implementation
2. Data validation scripts
3. Staged rollout
4. Legacy code removal
