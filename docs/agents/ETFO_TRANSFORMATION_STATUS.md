### üü° Phase B: Build ETFO-Aligned Models (IN PROGRESS)

#### B1: Define Planning Level Models
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Implemented Models**:
  1. ‚úÖ CurriculumExpectation (replaces Outcome)
  2. ‚úÖ LongRangePlan (yearly/term overview)
  3. ‚úÖ UnitPlan (replaces Milestone)
  4. ‚úÖ ETFOLessonPlan (replaces Activity)
  5. ‚úÖ DaybookEntry (daily reflections)
  
- **Additional Models Created**:
  - ‚úÖ CurriculumExpectationEmbedding (AI features)
  - ‚úÖ Junction tables for many-to-many relationships
  - ‚úÖ Resource models for Unit and Lesson plans

#### B2: Remove Legacy Models
- **Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING
- **Current State**: Legacy models (Milestone, Activity) still exist alongside new models
- **Migration Strategy**: ‚úÖ Created comprehensive migration script
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Run migration script on test data
  2. Implement feature flag system
  3. Gradual rollout to users
  4. Remove legacy code after full migration

### üü° API Implementation Status

#### Backend Routes
- ‚úÖ `/api/curriculum-expectations` - Full CRUD with search
- ‚úÖ `/api/long-range-plans` - Full CRUD with AI suggestions endpoint
- ‚úÖ `/api/unit-plans` - Full CRUD with resource management
- ‚úÖ `/api/etfo-lesson-plans` - Full CRUD with sub-friendly features
- ‚úÖ `/api/daybook-entries` - Full CRUD with insights endpoint

#### Frontend Implementation
- ‚úÖ Created `useETFOPlanning.ts` hooks for all models
- ‚úÖ Created `LongRangePlanPage.tsx` component
- ‚úÖ Updated navigation with Long-Range Planning link
- ‚è≥ Unit Plan UI (needs creation)
- ‚è≥ Lesson Plan UI (needs creation)
- ‚è≥ Daybook UI (needs creation)
- ‚è≥ Curriculum Expectations UI (needs creation)

### ‚è≥ Phase C: AI Integration (PENDING)

#### C1: AI-Assisted Curriculum Import
- **Status**: üü° PARTIAL (Infrastructure exists)
- **Existing Work**:
  - ‚úÖ CurriculumImport model created
  - ‚úÖ Embedding models for semantic search
  - ‚úÖ Import routes exist from Phase 5
- **Remaining Work**:
  - ‚è≥ Connect to new CurriculumExpectation model
  - ‚è≥ Implement clustering algorithm
  - ‚è≥ Create import wizard UI

#### C2: AI-Powered Planning Suggestions
- **Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING
- **Placeholder endpoints created but not implemented**:
  - Long-range plan theme suggestions
  - Unit plan grouping suggestions
  - Lesson plan generation
  - Daybook insight analysis

## Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration Tasks
- [x] Create new database models
- [x] Create migration scripts
- [x] Build new API endpoints
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Build feature flag system
- [ ] Create data validation scripts

### Migration Tasks
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Run migration on staging environment
- [ ] Test all new endpoints
- [ ] Migrate 5% of users (pilot)
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Migrate 25% of users
- [ ] Migrate 50% of users
- [ ] Migrate 100% of users

### Post-Migration Tasks
- [ ] Remove Milestone model and routes
- [ ] Remove Activity model and routes
- [ ] Remove legacy frontend components
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Clean up database indexes

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Data Loss During Migration**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive backups, transaction-based migration
   
2. **User Workflow Disruption**
   - Mitigation: Feature flags, gradual rollout, user training

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Load testing, index optimization

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Incomplete Feature Parity**
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing, user feedback loops

2. **AI Service Dependencies**
   - Mitigation: Fallback to manual processes

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete Frontend UI Components**:
   - Create UnitPlanPage.tsx
   - Create ETFOLessonPlanPage.tsx
   - Create DaybookPage.tsx
   - Create CurriculumExpectationsPage.tsx

2. **Implement Feature Flag System**:
   - Add ETFO_PLANNING_ENABLED flag
   - Create middleware to route based on flag
   - Build admin UI for flag management

3. **Create Test Data**:
   - Generate sample curriculum expectations
   - Create test long-range plans
   - Build example unit/lesson plans

4. **Run Migration Tests**:
   - Test migration script on development data
   - Validate data integrity
   - Performance test new models

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ All Phase A tasks completed (100%)
- üü° Phase B models created (70% - UI pending)
- ‚è≥ Phase C AI integration (0% - pending)
- Overall Progress: **~60% Complete**

## Conclusion

The ETFO transformation is progressing well with the core infrastructure in place. The main remaining work involves:
1. Completing the frontend UI for all planning levels
2. Implementing the feature flag system for safe rollout
3. Connecting AI services for enhanced planning features
4. Executing the migration plan with proper testing

The foundation is solid, and with focused effort on the remaining tasks, the transformation can be completed successfully.
