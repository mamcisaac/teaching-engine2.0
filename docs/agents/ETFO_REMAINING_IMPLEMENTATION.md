# ETFO Transformation: Remaining Implementation Tasks

## Executive Summary
Based on the original transformation document, we have completed Phase A (Remove Feature Creep) and most of Phase B (Core Models). The remaining work focuses on completing the UI implementation and AI integration.

## Remaining Tasks by Priority

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Complete for MVP)

#### 1. Complete Frontend UI Components (D1-D5)
These are the core user interfaces that teachers will interact with daily:

- **[D1] Curriculum Expectations UI** (`/curriculum`)
  - Browse, search, edit imported expectations
  - Filter by subject, type, usage status
  - Track which expectations are used in plans
  
- **[D2] Long-Range Plans UI** (`/long-range`) 
  - âœ… Basic page created, needs enhancement
  - Add term-based organization
  - Implement AI unit suggestions
  
- **[D3] Unit Plans UI** (`/units`)
  - Create comprehensive unit planning interface
  - Link to long-range plans and expectations
  - Include all ETFO-required fields
  
- **[D4] Lesson Plans UI** (`/lessons`)
  - Calendar or list view of lessons
  - Full ETFO lesson structure editor
  - Link to units and expectations
  
- **[D5] Daybook UI** (`/daybook`)
  - Weekly grid view
  - Auto-populate from lesson plans
  - Print-ready formats
  - Daily reflection capture

#### 2. Complete AI-Assisted Curriculum Import (C1)
- Create `/curriculum-import` page
- File upload interface for PDFs/DOCX
- Review and edit interface for extracted expectations
- Backend parsing pipeline with LLM integration

#### 3. Migration Execution (B2)
- Implement feature flag system
- Create data validation scripts
- Execute gradual rollout plan
- Remove legacy models after successful migration

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Enhanced User Experience)

#### 4. AI Draft Generation Services (E1-E5)
- **[E1]** Create centralized `aiDraftService.ts`
- **[E2]** Long-range plan generation from expectations
- **[E3]** Unit plan draft generation
- **[E4]** Lesson plan draft generation
- **[E5]** Daybook and substitute plan bundles

#### 5. Enhanced Navigation and User Flow
- Update main navigation to reflect 5-level hierarchy
- Create workflow guidance/wizard for new users
- Add progress indicators for planning completion

### ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Post-MVP)

#### 6. Advanced Features
- Curriculum coverage analytics
- Cross-curricular connection visualization
- Collaborative planning features
- Export to various formats (PDF, Word, etc.)

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Complete Core UI (1-2 weeks)
1. Create Unit Plans UI
2. Create Lesson Plans UI  
3. Create Daybook UI
4. Create Curriculum Expectations UI
5. Enhance Long-Range Plans UI

### Phase 2: AI Integration (1 week)
1. Implement curriculum import with AI parsing
2. Create aiDraftService.ts
3. Add AI generation buttons to each UI

### Phase 3: Migration & Cleanup (1 week)
1. Build feature flag system
2. Create validation scripts
3. Execute staged migration
4. Remove legacy code

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Component Structure
```typescript
// Example: UnitPlanPage.tsx
- Header with navigation breadcrumbs
- Filter/search bar
- Grid/list view of unit plans
- Modal for create/edit with ETFO fields:
  - Title, Duration, Big Ideas
  - Essential Questions (array)
  - Learning Goals, Success Criteria
  - Assessment For/As/Of Learning
  - Cross-curricular connections
  - Linked expectations (multi-select)
  - Teacher reflection notes
```

### API Endpoint Patterns
All endpoints follow RESTful conventions:
- `GET /api/{model}` - List with filters
- `GET /api/{model}/:id` - Single record with relations
- `POST /api/{model}` - Create new
- `PUT /api/{model}/:id` - Update existing
- `DELETE /api/{model}/:id` - Remove record
- `POST /api/{model}/:id/ai-draft` - Generate AI draft

### Database Relationships
```
CurriculumExpectation
  â†“ many-to-many
LongRangePlan
  â†“ one-to-many
UnitPlan
  â†“ one-to-many
ETFOLessonPlan
  â†“ one-to-one
DaybookEntry
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- [ ] All 5 planning levels have complete CRUD operations
- [ ] AI integration provides useful drafts 80%+ of the time
- [ ] Migration completes with 0% data loss
- [ ] Performance remains under 2s page load

### User Success
- [ ] Teachers can plan a full unit in <30 minutes
- [ ] Daily planning takes <10 minutes
- [ ] Substitute plans generate in <2 minutes
- [ ] 90%+ curriculum expectations tracked

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **AI Service Failures**
   - Implement retry logic
   - Provide manual fallbacks
   - Cache successful generations

2. **Migration Complexity**
   - Extensive testing on staging
   - Rollback procedures ready
   - User communication plan

### User Adoption Risks
1. **Learning Curve**
   - In-app tutorials
   - Video walkthroughs
   - Support documentation

2. **Workflow Changes**
   - Gradual feature introduction
   - Feedback loops
   - Quick iteration cycles

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Today**: Create UnitPlanPage.tsx with full ETFO fields
2. **Tomorrow**: Create ETFOLessonPlanPage.tsx
3. **This Week**: Complete all UI components
4. **Next Week**: Implement AI services and curriculum import

## Conclusion

The foundation is solid with models and API endpoints in place. The primary remaining work is creating the user-facing components that teachers will interact with daily. By following the ETFO planning model exactly and providing AI assistance at each level, we'll deliver a tool that significantly reduces teacher workload while improving curriculum alignment.
