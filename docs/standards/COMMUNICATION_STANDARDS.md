# Communication Standards for Teaching Engine 2.0

## üéØ Purpose

This document establishes comprehensive communication standards for the Teaching Engine 2.0 project, covering inter-agent communication protocols, progress reporting requirements, parent communication guidelines, and system messaging standards.

## üìã Inter-Agent Communication Protocols

### 1. Agent Coordination Standards

#### Communication Channels
- **Primary**: GitHub issues and pull requests for feature discussions
- **Documentation**: Agent logs in `/docs/agents/logs/AGENT-{NAME}-LOG.md`
- **Real-time**: Code comments with `// TODO: Coordinate with Agent-X` pattern
- **Integration**: Shared interfaces defined in `/server/src/types/shared/`

#### Message Format for Agent Coordination
```markdown
## Coordination Request: [URGENT/NORMAL/FYI]

**From**: Agent-[Name]
**To**: Agent-[Name] 
**Subject**: [Brief description]

### Context
[Why this coordination is needed]

### Request
[Specific action or information needed]

### Impact
[How this affects the requesting agent's work]

### Timeline
[When response/action is needed]

### Dependencies
[What depends on this coordination]
```

#### Response Requirements
- **Urgent**: Response within 4 hours (same work session)
- **Normal**: Response within 24 hours
- **FYI**: Acknowledgment within 48 hours

### 2. Code Integration Protocols

#### Shared Interface Changes
- Must document in `/docs/api/SHARED_INTERFACES.md`
- Requires approval from affected agents
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Include migration guide for breaking changes

#### Database Model Coordination
