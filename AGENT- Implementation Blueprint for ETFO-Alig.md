# Implementation Blueprint for ETFO-Aligned Planning Workflow

This plan restructures Teaching-Engine 2.0 around the ETFO _Planning for Student Learning_ model, enforcing a strict five-stage flow: **(1) Curriculum Expectations → (2) Long-Range Plans → (3) Unit Plans → (4) Lesson Plans → (5) Daybook Entries**. Each stage is a distinct UI section with its own data model. The interface uses a persistent sidebar or progress bar to guide the teacher through these stages in order, ensuring the previous stage is completed before proceeding. In line with ETFO’s OAR (Organize–Act–Reflect) approach, each level presents tailored templates (Big Ideas, Learning Goals, Assessment _for/as/of_, Cross-Curricular Connections, Reflections, etc.) drawn directly from the book’s examples. A clean, minimal interface (e.g. React with Tailwind) will have a sidebar menu labeled “Curriculum → Long-Range → Units → Lessons → Daybook”. Icons and step indicators help teachers always know their location. The UI allows drag-and-drop where appropriate (e.g. reorganizing expectations or schedule slots) and provides context-help tips for first-time users.

- **Persistent Navigation:** A sidebar lists the five planning levels. Each item shows completion status (e.g. a checkmark) and the count of curriculum expectations covered so far. Clicking a level opens that view; levels beyond an unfinished one are disabled or prompt a reminder to “complete previous plan first.”
- **Progress Flow:** The UI enforces sequential workflow. For example, the _Unit Plans_ screen cannot be used until a _Long-Range Plan_ exists for the corresponding term. After finishing a Long-Range Plan, the sidebar unlocks “Unit Plans,” etc. This scaffolding ensures logical progression as in the book. The interface can also include a step-progress bar (1 of 5) to emphasize sequence.
- **Expectation Coverage Display:** Each stage’s view prominently lists the **Overall and Specific Curriculum Expectations** being addressed. For example, the Long-Range and Unit plan editors show checkboxes or tags for each expectation, with visual cues (color codes or progress bars) to indicate which expectations have been planned vs. still open. This follows the book’s emphasis on knowing which curriculum points are taught. Users can filter or sort by expectations to find any that remain unassigned, ensuring 100% coverage.

## Data Model Refactoring

Each planning level is backed by its own database table (or collection) with clear relationships:

- **CurriculumExpectation:** Represents curriculum standards (both _Overall_ and _Specific_). It includes fields like `id`, `subject`, `grade`, `code` (e.g. “1.1A”), `type` (“overall” or “specific”), and a text description. The system should preload or import a curriculum (e.g. Ontario standards) so teachers can search and select expectations. Expectations link to Long-Range and other plans via join tables (many-to-many, since a plan can cover multiple expectations).
- **LongRangePlan:** Contains year/term overview. Fields include `id`, `title` (e.g. “Grade 5 Term 1 Overview”), `term`, `subject`, and text fields for Big Ideas, Overarching Learning Goals, and assessment strategies. It also lists **selected curriculum expectations** (as foreign keys or JSON array). It may contain an ordered list of planned **Units** (established when Unit Plans are created) and target timeline/dates.
- **UnitPlan:** Represents a multi-week unit. Fields include `id`, `longRangePlanId` (FK), `unitTitle`, `bigIdeas`, `essentialQuestions`, `learningGoals`, `successCriteria`, **Assessment For/As/Of** (to be chosen via checkboxes), Cross-Curricular Connections, Differentiation Strategies, and a reflection field. It also stores which **Overall/Specific Expectations** it addresses, and which lessons (by FK) it contains.
- **LessonPlan:** Daily or multi-day lesson. Fields include `id`, `unitPlanId` (FK), `lessonTitle`, `lessonNumber`, `dateRange`, plus sections for _Learning Intention/Goals_, _Success Criteria_, **Assessment (For/As/Of)**, _Resources_, _Accommodations/Modifications_, and step-by-step _Instructional Activities_. Importantly, each LessonPlan includes a **“Teacher Reflection”** field that is intended to be filled _after_ delivery. The model also records linked expectations covered in that lesson and perhaps linked resources or materials.
- **DaybookEntry:** Represents the actual daily schedule. Fields include `id`, `date`, `teacherId`, plus `lessonPlans` (list of one or more LessonPlan IDs scheduled that day). Additional fields include daily routines, substitute teacher notes, and an _End-of-Day Reflection/Notes_ section. Daybook entries aggregate content from their LessonPlans (e.g. time, subject, objectives) but allow editing for real-world changes.

All models are connected via foreign keys: e.g. a UnitPlan FK to LongRangePlan, a LessonPlan FK to UnitPlan, DaybookEntries FK to LessonPlans. This enforces the hierarchical workflow. None of the five concepts overlap: for example, we do **not** use “milestone” or “activity” as a catch-all. Instead, _LongRangePlan_, _UnitPlan_, _LessonPlan_, _DaybookEntry_ are distinct entities. This separation matches the book’s distinct chapters and avoids one concept subsuming multiple levels.

## Planning Stages & UI Templates

### 1. Curriculum Expectations Setup

**UI & Workflow:** The first screen after signing in is a **Curriculum Expectations Browser**. Teachers select their province/grade/subject, then see a list of _Overall_ and _Specific_ expectations from the curriculum. They check off which ones they plan to cover this year (or this term). This step establishes scope and sequence. The UI allows filtering (by keyword or code) and visually marks those already planned. It also shows at a glance the expectations “covered” (from existing plans) vs. “pending.”
**Template Elements:** This stage uses simple forms/tables – no heavy text templates yet. It’s mainly a curriculum map. Teachers can annotate or comment on chosen expectations (e.g. highlight focus areas). Once done, the selected expectations feed into the Long-Range Plan generation.
**Data Impact:** Selections here populate a `CurriculumExpectationCoverage` table linking expectation IDs to the teacher’s planning cycle. All later plans reference this set as the basis for content.

### 2. Long-Range Plans

**UI & Workflow:** Accessible after expectations are set. The **Long-Range Plan** screen lets the teacher lay out major units for the year or term. A form prompts for _Big Ideas / Key Understandings_, _Primary Learning Goals_, _Summary of Assessment Strategies (For/As/Of)_, _Cross-Curricular Links_, and a reflection box (e.g. “Anticipated challenges”). The UI can display a timeline/calendar where the teacher roughly blocks each unit (e.g. “6 weeks on Fractions”).
**Templates:** The layout mirrors ETFO’s long-range templates. For example, a table with columns “Topics/Units” | “Overall Expectations” | “Timeline” | “Big Ideas” | “Assessment” etc., as seen in the book. Each unit is a row. Checkboxes allow selecting which **Overall and Specific Expectations** from step 1 are addressed in each unit (ensuring alignment). The UI shows which expectations are still uncovered.
**Data Model:** Each unit entered here creates a _LongRangePlan_ record with nested unit entries (or creates related UnitPlan stubs). The LongRangePlan stores the overall curriculum goals and expected duration. It links to CurriculumExpectation via FKs.
**Scaffolding:** When saving a Long-Range Plan, the system automatically marks its covered expectations as planned. The interface then enables “Unit Plans” for those units.

### 3. Unit Plans

**UI & Workflow:** On the **Unit Plans** page, teachers see a list of units from the Long-Range Plan. Clicking a unit opens a unit editor. The editor contains sections for: _Unit Title_, _Big Ideas / Fundamental Concepts_, _Essential/Driving Questions_, _Learning Goals_ (detailed success criteria), **Assessment For/As/Of** (choose multiple via toggle), _Resources/Materials_, _Differentiation/Accommodations_, and _Cross-Curricular Connections_. At the bottom is a “Reflection & Next Steps” section for after teaching the unit.
**Templates:** This mirrors Chapter 5 in the book. For instance, a template with “Big Ideas | Overall Expectations | Learning Goals” columns (as in figure/table in book). The UI pre-fills Overall Expectations from the Long-Range mapping. Learning Goals can be written or auto-generated (AI assistance, see below). The page also shows a checklist of “Progress on this Unit’s Expectations,” updating as lessons get planned.
**Data Model:** Each UnitPlan record includes text fields for all above sections and an array of selected CurriculumExpectation FKs. It links to its parent LongRangePlan. Lessons created under this unit (in next stage) will reference this UnitPlan ID.
**Scaffolding:** The interface suggests default unit length and possible lesson counts from the Long-Range timeline. Teachers cannot create a unit without an associated Long-Range block, ensuring consistency.

### 4. Lesson Plans

**UI & Workflow:** The **Lesson Plans** view is where teachers build daily lesson details. It can be accessed via two paths: (a) from the UnitPlan (e.g. “Create Lesson for Unit X”) or (b) on a calendar week view. Each lesson editor includes fields for _Lesson Title/Number_, _Date(s)/Time_, _Subject_, _Overall/Specific Expectations_ (auto-filled from unit), _Learning Intention_, _Success Criteria_, _Assessment For/As/Of_ (ticked per lesson), _Resources_, and _Accommodations_. Crucially, it has a **Teacher Reflection** field labeled “Reflection (to be completed after lesson)”.
**Templates:** This follows Chapter 6 templates. For example, a lesson plan table as in the book’s sample: rows for “Beginning/Hook”, “Middle”, “End/Wrap-up”, with columns for _Activities_, _Differentiation_, _Assessment_, etc. The book’s template 3 (Chapter 6) is a guide for structure. The UI form will have sections for instructional steps and sections for summary info (Learning Goal, Success Criteria, Assessment, Reflection). The system ensures every lesson plan includes a reflection section.
**Data Model:** Each LessonPlan record includes all text entries for the above sections, plus FKs to its UnitPlan and its CurriculumExpectations. It may also record estimated _time required_ and _lesson number_ (to sequence multi-day lessons). Completed lessons update progress on the UnitPlan.
**Scaffolding:** A LessonPlan can only be created if its parent UnitPlan exists. The UI can show a week or day calendar overlay: when a teacher drops a LessonPlan onto a date, it auto-fills the date and suggests tying to the current unit. This keeps the chain: Curriculum→LongRange→Unit→Lesson.

### 5. Daybook Entries

**UI & Workflow:** The **Daybook** is the daily planner/record. It lists dates (like a calendar) with slots for each lesson or activity. Clicking a date opens that day’s entry. The system auto-populates the daybook from approved LessonPlans: for each scheduled lesson it pulls in the Lesson Title, Objectives, and resources. The daybook editor displays a timeline of the day (e.g. 9:00–9:45 Math, 10:00–10:45 English, etc.), with embedded lesson summaries. Teachers can add non-curricular events (recess, assemblies), reorder things, or add ad-hoc notes.
**Templates:** The Daybook template follows Chapter 7. It includes fields for _Date_, _Daily Big Ideas (if any)_, a column for each period’s content, and an _End-of-Day Reflection_ box. It also contains a _Substitute Notes_ section where teachers can tick key points from lessons in case of absence. The UI might present a “print view” of the daybook row.
**Data Model:** Each DaybookEntry links to the date, teacher, and includes references to LessonPlan IDs taught that day. Fields include `subNotes` (instructions for substitute), `endOfDayReflection`, and boolean flags for “Requires Parent Communication.” Daybook entries are versioned as the day progresses (initial plan vs. final notes).
**Scaffolding:** A Daybook entry cannot exist without at least one LessonPlan scheduled for that day. Once lessons are created or scheduled, the Daybook auto-generates the daily draft (the “day plan”). The teacher then completes reflections at day’s end, possibly creating the final version. The system can auto-compile a week’s Daybook as a single printable substitute plan.

## AI-Driven Drafting at Each Level

To reduce workload, the app embeds AI-assistance on every screen:

- **Curriculum Expectations:** An AI agent can suggest a prioritized list of overall/specific expectations given grade and subject. For example, it might highlight key expectations based on curriculum guidelines or past use. This could use a fine-tuned LLM trained on curriculum documents.
- **Long-Range Plan:** Given the chosen expectations, the AI generates a draft year plan. It proposes _units/themes_, timelines, and big ideas. Prompt: _“Based on \[selected expectations] for Grade X \[subject], draft a long-range scope & sequence with 4–6 units, including Big Ideas and overall learning goals.”_ The teacher edits this draft. (This aligns with the idea of “AI-powered curriculum import” in the roadmap.)
- **Unit Plan:** AI drafts each unit’s content from the Long-Range outline. It creates Big Ideas, essential questions, learning goals, and assessment strategies (For/As/Of). It uses the specific expectations mapped to that unit plus any teacher notes. Example: _“For unit on \[Big Idea] covering expectations \[list], write 3-5 learning goals and suggest assessments.”_ The teacher refines as needed.
- **Lesson Plan:** For each unit, AI auto-generates individual lesson outlines. Using the unit’s learning goals and selected expectations, it suggests activities for Beginning/Middle/End, resources, and formative assessment. It also fills in the “Assessment For/As/Of” checkboxes based on the goal. Example prompt: _“Draft a 45-min lesson plan for \[unit] focusing on \[learning goal]. Include success criteria, activities, and assessment strategies.”_ The result populates the template fields (Learning Intention, Success Criteria, Steps, Reflection placeholder) for teacher review.
- **Daybook Entry:** Once lessons are scheduled, the AI compiles a daybook draft. It collates the lesson objectives and suggests daily big ideas, cross-curricular notes or a “special focus” for the day. It can pre-fill the substitute notes by summarizing each lesson’s main points. After the teacher finalizes the plan and teaches, the AI can assist by summarizing reflections or suggesting reflective comments based on teacher inputs.

All AI content is editable by the teacher, ensuring they remain in control. Importantly, prompts draw on **curriculum + teacher’s previous plans + best-practice examples**. For example, the book’s own templates and publicly available exemplar plans can be used to fine-tune or prompt the model, ensuring output matches the ETFO style. Transparency is key: the UI might annotate AI suggestions (e.g. “Suggested by AI”) and allow easy editing and approval.

## Functional Dependencies & Integration

The entire system ensures forward-scaffolding: each stage’s output seeds the next stage’s input. Key dependencies include:

- **Expectation Mapping:** Curriculum Expectations feed into Long-Range Plan (which draws from them), then into Unit Plans, then into Lesson Plans. The database enforces these links (FKs and many-to-many tables).
- **Coverage Tracking:** Whenever a LessonPlan is marked complete, the system updates progress bars at the Unit and Long-Range levels (e.g. “3 of 5 lessons done – 60% of unit covered”). This is visualized in the UI to show on-track vs behind-schedule, echoing ETFO’s advice on pacing.
- **Template Alignment:** Each view’s template is hard-coded to match the book’s sections. For example, selecting “Cross-Curricular Connections” in a unit plan UI takes the teacher to a text area with help text (“List how this unit connects to other subjects”).
- **Bundling for Prints/Sub Plans:** The UI includes a “Generate Substitute Plan” button on the Daybook view. This compiles the week’s lessons plus substitute notes into a PDF, as recommended. Similarly, a “Print Weekly Overview” compiles a formatted week view of the daybook.

Throughout, the app remains a web-based React/TypeScript system (per existing stack), with a Node/Express backend and a relational DB (Prisma/Postgres). Each planning level has its own API endpoints and Redux/Query hooks for data. For example, creating a UnitPlan triggers a POST to `/api/units` and auto-fetches the related LongRangePlan to verify consistency.

**Citations:** This design directly mirrors ETFO’s structure: “long-range plans, unit plans, lesson plans and daybook pages” each as “distinct form\[s] of planning”. It includes all the book’s required components – Big Ideas, learning goals, “Assessment For/As/Of learning,” cross-curricular connections, and reflections – in the respective data models and UI templates. The interface follows the Implementation Plan’s recommendation for a clear, teacher-friendly sidebar layout and minimal clicks. AI is leveraged at each step to “build a roadmap” for instruction, giving teachers draft plans they can refine. This blueprint ensures Teaching-Engine 2.0 faithfully operationalizes the ETFO planning workflow, automating clerical work while preserving teachers’ creative control.
